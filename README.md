# Cheerleaders Kraków

This is a project for a non-profit organization that my mom is involved in.

A Next.js static export site for a cheerleading team in Kraków, Poland. It showcases the team, news, and championship information, with content managed via PagesCMS markdown files under `content/`.

## Basic setup

```bash
npm install
```

## Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 to view the site.

## Quality checks

```bash
npm run lint
npm test
npm run build
```
